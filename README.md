# Chataigne
Artist-friendly Modular Machine for Art and Technology
Official website : http://benjamin.kuperberg.fr/chataigne

### Intro

Chataigne is made with one goal in mind : create a common tool for artists, technicians and developers who wish to use technology and synchronize softwares for shows, interactive installations or prototyping.
It aims to be as simple as possible for basic interactions, but can be easily extended to create complex interactions.

### Okay, but what does it do exactly ?

While Chataigne won't do much by itself, its purpose is to be the central hub in a project involving multiple interfaces, softwares, devices and sensors.
You can see it as a Conductor, which will control all the softwares with the big picture in mind.
Chataigne as been designed to fit both linear shows and realtime/interactive project needs.

## Building the software

Chataigne is built on top of the JUCE frameworks. You can find more infos about it there : http://www.juce.com
Chataigne is using a modified version of JUCE. So you first need to compile the Projucer from the modified version of JUCE instead of downloading JUCE :

  - Clone the develop-local branch from the JUCE git here : http://github.com/benkuper/JUCE 
  ```
  git clone --branch=develop-local http://github.com/benkuper/JUCE
  ```
  - In the *JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds* folder, choose the folder depending on you system, open the solution with your IDE and compile it or make in linux. You can then open the new Projucer app that you just built.
  
  - Clone Chataigne with --recursive options to integrate organicUI and timeline modules
  ```
  git clone --recursive http://github.com/benkuper/Chataigne
  ```
  - Launch the Projucer and open Chataigne.jucer
  - Save the jucer
  - Open the solution for you platform in the Builds folder
  - Build the solution from your IDE and compile it or make in linux
  - Check the dependency section below if you have dependency problems when running Chataigne
  - Enjoy !
